# xChain Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development plan for the xChain project, including the implementation of a comprehensive logging system to capture all interactions and outputs during the development process.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure

1. Initialize project repository
   - Set up Git repository
   - Create initial project structure
   - Set up TypeScript configuration

2. Implement basic logging system
   - Create `Logger` class with methods for different log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR)
   - Implement file logging for capturing all development interactions
   - Set up console logging with MTG-themed formatting

3. Develop base classes
   - Implement `Component` base class
   - Create `Mana` class for resource management
   - Develop `GameState` class for managing game state

4. Set up testing framework
   - Configure Jest for TypeScript
   - Write initial unit tests for base classes

## Phase 2: Core Gameplay Components

1. Implement card type classes
   - Develop `Creature`, `Instant`, `Sorcery`, `Enchantment`, and `Artifact` classes
   - Write unit tests for each card type

2. Create deck and chain systems
   - Implement `Deck` class for managing collections of cards
   - Develop `Chain` class for executing sequences of cards
   - Write integration tests for deck and chain interactions

3. Enhance logging system
   - Implement detailed logging for card execution and chain resolution
   - Add visual representations of "cards played" and "effects resolved" in logs

## Phase 3: AI Integration

1. Set up Ollama integration
   - Implement `AIService` class for interfacing with Ollama
   - Create wrapper methods for common AI operations

2. Develop AI-powered cards
   - Create AI-enhanced versions of each card type
   - Implement logging for AI operations and decisions

3. Expand testing suite
   - Write unit tests for AI-powered cards
   - Develop integration tests for AI-driven chains

## Phase 4: Tutorial System

1. Design tutorial framework
   - Create `Tutorial` class for managing lessons
   - Implement progress tracking and lesson navigation

2. Develop initial set of tutorials
   - Create introductory lessons on basic concepts
   - Implement interactive exercises using AI components

3. Enhance logging for tutorials
   - Add detailed logging for tutorial progress and user interactions
   - Implement summary logs for completed tutorials

## Phase 5: Advanced Features and Optimization

1. Implement advanced MTG-inspired strategies
   - Develop complex AI chains based on classic MTG decks (e.g., The Rock, Psychatog)
   - Create logging visualizations for strategy execution

2. Optimize performance
   - Conduct performance profiling
   - Implement optimizations for resource usage and chain execution

3. Enhance error handling and debugging
   - Implement advanced error logging and tracing
   - Develop debugging tools using logged information

## Phase 6: Documentation and Polish

1. Comprehensive documentation
   - Write detailed API documentation using TypeDoc
   - Create user guides and tutorials in Markdown

2. Refine logging system
   - Implement log analysis tools
   - Create visualizations for logged data

3. Final testing and bug fixes
   - Conduct thorough system-wide testing
   - Address any remaining issues identified in logs

## Continuous Tasks

Throughout all phases:

1. Maintain and update project roadmap
2. Regularly commit code and push to repository
3. Update README.md with new features and instructions
4. Review and analyze logs for insights and improvements
5. Seek and incorporate user feedback

## Logging Implementation Details

To ensure comprehensive logging throughout the development process:

1. Create a `DevelopmentLogger` class that extends the basic `Logger`:
   - Implement methods to log prompts, commands, responses, and outputs
   - Use timestamps for all log entries
   - Categorize log entries (e.g., [PROMPT], [COMMAND], [RESPONSE], [OUTPUT])

2. Integrate logging into all major components:
   - Log the execution of each method in core classes
   - Capture inputs and outputs of AI operations
   - Record user interactions in the tutorial system

3. Implement log rotation to manage file sizes:
   - Create new log files daily or when size limits are reached
   - Maintain an archive of past log files

4. Develop log analysis tools:
   - Create scripts to parse and analyze log files
   - Generate summaries and visualizations of development progress

5. Use logs for debugging and optimization:
   - Implement log-based error tracing
   - Analyze logs to identify performance bottlenecks

By following this roadmap and implementing comprehensive logging, we'll create a well-structured, thoroughly documented xChain project with a rich history of its development process captured in the logs.
